summary: We introduce the anatomical and statistical retinal receptor distribution into our
  computational hologram optimization, which places a higher priority on
  reducing the perceived foveal speckle noise while being adaptable to any
  individual's optical aberration on the retina.

abstract: Computer-generated holographic (CGH) displays show great potential and
  are emerging as the next-generation displays for augmented and virtual
  reality, and automotive heads-up displays. One of the critical problems
  harming the wide adoption of such displays is the presence of speckle noise
  inherent to holography, which compromises its quality by introducing
  perceptible artifacts. Although speckle noise suppression has been an active
  research area, the previous works have not considered the perceptual
  characteristics of the Human Visual System (HVS), which receives the final
  displayed imagery. However, it is well-studied that the sensitivity of the HVS
  is not uniform across the visual field, which has led to gaze-contingent
  rendering schemes for maximizing the perceptual quality in various
  computer-generated imagery. Inspired by this, we present the first method that
  reduces the “perceived speckle noise” by integrating the foveal and peripheral
  vision characteristics of the HVS, along with the retinal point spread
  function, into the phase hologram computation. Specifically, we introduce the
  anatomical and statistical retinal receptor distribution into our
  computational hologram optimization, which places a higher priority on
  reducing the perceived foveal speckle noise while being adaptable to any
  individual's optical aberration on the retina. Our method demonstrates
  superior perceptual quality on our emulated holographic display. Our
  evaluations with objective measurements and subjective studies demonstrate a
  significant reduction of the human perceived noise.
