I am a second-year PhD student at Computer Science department in University of California, Davis. I feel very fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. Joesph Teran and Prof. Julian Panetta.

My research interests lie in digital fabrication, physical simulation and geometry processing for computer graphics. Currently, I am working on research related to shape optimization on nonlinear elasticity materials.

Before joining UC Davis, I double majored in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Science and Technology of China. I was glad to be supervised by Prof. Ligang Liu and Prof. Xiaoming Fu in Graphics & Geometric Computing Laboratory.
