I am a second-year PhD student in the Computer Science department at the University of California, Davis. I feel very fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Joseph Teran](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~jteran/) and Prof. [Julian Panetta](https://julianpanetta.com/).

My research interests lie in digital fabrication, physical simulation, and geometry processing for computer graphics. Currently, I am working on research related to shape optimization on nonlinear elasticity materials.

Before joining UC Davis, I double majored in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Science and Technology of China. I was glad to be supervised by Prof. [Ligang Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lgliu/) and Prof. [Xiaoming Fu](https://ustc-gcl-f.github.io/) in Graphics & Geometric Computing Laboratory.
